# Nail Salon Backend Server

This folder contains an Express.js server using Prisma ORM and JWT authentication.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies (requires internet access):
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```
2. Create the SQLite database using Prisma:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   node prisma/seed.js
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The server runs on port `3001` by default.

## MSSQL Database

If you prefer to use Microsoft SQL Server, run the SQL script at `server/mssql/schema.sql`:

```bash
sqlcmd -S <your-server> -i server/mssql/schema.sql
```

This creates the same tables as the Prisma schema and inserts sample data for
designers, service categories (including descriptions, pricing and timing
details) and services.

## Project Structure
